Added function for parallel thermalisation of N initial states.

We thermalise one high T (reference) state along with N-1 low T (worker) states. Proper thermalisation is checked
by comparing the energy of the worker states with the reference state. We require that the average energy difference
between the worker and reference states is less than some number (typically 0.1) times the standard deviation over
an interval of some MCS (4000), to achieve thermalisation.

Testing:    -Seems to be working fine for lattices up to L=80 (havent tested higher)
            -STD_NUMBER doesn't affect much when it is above 0.1 (the code sometimes struggles below this).
            -Number of MCS does not rise dramatically with increasing lattice size (typically 10‚Å¥ MCS for the testing 
             parameters used)
            -The thermalised (averaged) energies deviates (within the workers and reference state). However each energy
             doesn't consequently increase or decrease over the average interval, and over several simulation they change role 
             (i.e. the reference state can end up both abit below or above the worker states). This indicates thermalisation,
             but the MC dynamics are quite slow (more than 4000MCS required to get good averages).
